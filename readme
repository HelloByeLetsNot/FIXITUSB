# USB Zero-Fill Tool

This Python script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing zero-fills on USB storage devices. Zero-filling a USB drive clears all data, flags, and settings, effectively resetting it to a blank state. This tool simulates the finishing process as done in the factory.

## Features

- Select a USB drive from the dropdown menu.
- Refresh the list of available drives.
- Perform zero-fill operation with the click of a button.
- Dynamically adjust the window size to fit content.
- Uses the Breeze Dark theme for a modern look.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (Python's standard GUI library)

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `usb_zero_fill.py` script using Python.
3. Select the USB drive you want to zero-fill from the dropdown menu.
4. Click the "Zero Fill" button to start the zero-fill process.
5. Wait for the process to complete, and check the result displayed in the GUI.

## Notes

- **Caution:** Zero-filling a USB drive will irreversibly erase all data on the selected drive. Use this tool with caution and ensure you have selected the correct drive.
- **Administrative Privileges:** Depending on your operating system, you may need to run the script with administrative privileges to access certain drives.
